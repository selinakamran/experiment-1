      <p>My earliest memory of the internet would have to be around the time when I was 12 or 13. I vividly remember this expierence as I had just gotten a Ipad for my birthday and prior to this I had never had any electoranic accessiores. I remember this time so well because the main reason I wanted an Ipad was so I can watch Barbie in Rock'N Royals. I was obsessed with Barbie at the time and when I first found the movie on a pirated website I felt so ecstatic! The ability to have a whole movie in my lap was a feeling like no other. Everything was so simple at the moment and I spent hours on end just watching and rewatching Barbie movies. </p>

         <h4>Exploring with Barbie</h4>
   <p> As I stated above, I learn ed how to pirate movies online quicly at a young age, this was true because I back in my home country of Iran all shows that are considered too "American" which includes Barbie are banned. <span>You cannot access them unless you get the pirated version. Therefore I kept this knowledge with me and used it to my advantage and continually stream movies without paying!</span> </p>
   <p> While growing up with the internet another very important memory I have from this time frame is when I downloaded Pixel Gun Fight. This was one of my first online games and I specifcally remember having a Princess Courtney skin in the game. I discovered a few years ago that Pixel Gun Fight had become more restricted and you coudlnt just make any skin that you wanted to and additionaly you had to pay in the end to keep the skins you create. It's unfortaunt how much everything has changed regarding the internet and how lost society and this capalistic country has become. Having fun comes with a literal price tag no matter what today. </p>
